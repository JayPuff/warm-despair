# What is this ?

Modified Dark Mode Warm theme.
Currently used for web development in JS/TS Vue

Will highlight Vue `v-for`, `v-if`, and other vue related shorthands like `:`, `#` or `@` in a greenish color on templates for easier visual parsing

Expects proper language extensions to be installed before hand.
Ex: Volar for vue, Sass/Pug accordingly for those as well, etc.
